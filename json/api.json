The TD urges cross-boundary travellers to plan ahead of their trips and allow sufficient travelling time. \n\nThe TD has been steering local and cross-boundary public transport (PT) services operators to enhance their capacity and reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet the transport needs of cross-boundary passengers during and around the New Year holiday. It is anticipated that the waiting time for PT services, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and local franchised bus “B” routes connecting various land-based BCPs, may be longer during peak periods of cross-boundary travel. Passengers should avoid travelling during peak hours, observe order while queuing and heed advice from on-site Police and staff of the PT operators. Passengers intending to take cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance. \n\nMotorists of cross-boundary private cars crossing the border are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at Lok Ma Chau Control Point and Shenzhen Bay Port during and around the New Year holiday to secure smooth access for PT vehicles to the above BCPs. Cross-boundary private cars may experience longer waiting times when crossing the BCPs during the peak periods. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the approach roads to the BCPs. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site Police. \n\nFor the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD’s HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility. gov. hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check the real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts “hzmbzhport” or “zhuhaifabu” (traffic-info. gzazhka. com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles must not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority. \n\nResidents and visitors may visit “Easy Boundary” (www. sb. gov. hk/eng/bwt/status. html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, or the HKeMobility to obtain useful information, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land-based BCPs, as well as for the Gold Bus, the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) and MTR to plan their trips and save waiting time. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio, the television broadcasts, the TD's website (www. td. gov. hk) and the HKeMobility.",
