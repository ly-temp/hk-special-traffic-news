The TD urges the public and visitors to plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient travelling time. \n\nThe TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to enhance their capacity and reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet the travel needs of passengers during the public holiday. It is anticipated that the waiting time for public transport services, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs, may be longer. Passengers are advised to plan their journeys ahead, allow sufficient travelling time and travel outside peak periods as far as possible. \n\nMotorists are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at Lok Ma Chau Control Point and Shenzhen Bay Port from 1 to 8 October 2025 to allow smooth access of public transport vehicles to above control points. Cross-boundary private cars may need to queue up for crossing the BCPs. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the road. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site Police. \n\nFor the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of TD’s “HKeMobility” mobile application or TD’s website (hkemobility. gov. hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access the snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port.
