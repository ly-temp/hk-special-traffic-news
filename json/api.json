As a large number of spectators is expected to disperse at the same time, the Transport Department (TD) urges those leaving the venue to take the MTR as far as possible. The TD has been steering public transport service arrangements and the overall traffic conditions have mostly been smooth so far: MTR: - The headway of the Tuen Ma Line has been enhanced to disperse spectators; - Of note, for cross-boundary travellers, the last train to Lo Wu Station on the ERL via interchanging at Tai Wai Station will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm; Special bus routes: - Eleven special bus routes have been arranged at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area departing for ports and major districts across the territory; - Cross-boundary travellers may take route no. SP12 to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange and transfer to the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port; or route No. A25S to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and transfer to the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to Macao and Zhuhai; and Taxis: - Taxi pick-up/drop-off area at Kai Tak Stadium (G/F outside Gate H) is opened for taxi pick-up. In view of an outflux of spectators, the waiting time is anticipated to be longer and your patience is appreciated. As a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the concert, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. Spectators are advised to take heed of the real-time information via on-site broadcast and the \"Easy Leave\" (easyleave. police. gov. hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www. td. gov. hk), the \"HKeMobility\" mobile application, radio and television broadcasts.",
